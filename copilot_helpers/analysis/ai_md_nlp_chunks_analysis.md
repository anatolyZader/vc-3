**Splitting Method:** Semantic + Structure-aware (NLP Text Splitter)  

## ðŸ§  NLP Semantic Splitting Overview

This document demonstrates advanced NLP-powered text splitting that combines:
- **Structure-First Approach**: Splits by markdown AST nodes (headings, code blocks, tables)
- **Semantic Coherence**: Uses embedding similarity to detect topic boundaries
- **Linguistic Intelligence**: Sentence-level analysis with semantic merging
- **Token Management**: Respects token budgets while maintaining semantic integrity

The splitter uses the `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for 384-dimensional sentence embeddings and applies cosine similarity analysis to detect topic shifts.

### Chunk Distribution by Type
- **Section**: 4 chunks (100.0%)

### Semantic Splitting Benefits

This NLP-powered approach provides several advantages over simple text splitting:

1. **Topic Coherence**: Embeddings detect semantic boundaries, keeping related content together
2. **Structure Preservation**: Markdown hierarchy is maintained through AST parsing
3. **Intelligent Merging**: Adjacent sentences are merged based on semantic similarity
4. **Token Budget Respect**: Stays within configured token limits while maintaining meaning
5. **Overlap Management**: Provides contextual overlap between chunks for better retrieval

### Use Cases for RAG Applications

Each chunk is optimized for:
- **Question Answering**: Coherent topic coverage enables accurate responses
- **Semantic Search**: Embedding-aware splitting improves retrieval relevance  
- **Context Building**: Related information stays together for better AI understanding
- **Documentation Analysis**: Preserves document structure while enabling granular access

The AI module documentation has been successfully processed into 4 semantically coherent chunks, ready for integration into RAG pipelines and AI-powered documentation systems.
