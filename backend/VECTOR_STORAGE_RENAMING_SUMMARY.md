# Renaming Summary: VectorStorageManager → VectorStorageService

## Files Renamed

### Primary File
- **From**: `business_modules/ai/infrastructure/ai/rag_pipelines/data_preparation/processors/vectorStorageManager.js`
- **To**: `business_modules/ai/infrastructure/ai/rag_pipelines/data_preparation/processors/vectorStorageService.js`

## Class Name Changes

### Class Definition
- **From**: `class VectorStorageManager`
- **To**: `class VectorStorageService`

### Module Export
- **From**: `module.exports = VectorStorageManager;`
- **To**: `module.exports = VectorStorageService;`

## Import Updates

### dataPreparationPipeline.js
```javascript
// Before
const VectorStorageManager = require('./processors/vectorStorageManager');
this.vectorStorageManager = new VectorStorageManager({...});

// After
const VectorStorageService = require('./processors/vectorStorageService');
this.vectorStorageManager = new VectorStorageService({...});
```

### index.js
```javascript
// Before
VectorStorageManager: require('./data_preparation/processors/vectorStorageManager'),

// After
VectorStorageService: require('./data_preparation/processors/vectorStorageService'),
```

## Comments Updated

### processingStrategyManager.js
```javascript
// Before
// Create vector IDs for changed files (matching the pattern used in VectorStorageManager)

// After
// Create vector IDs for changed files (matching the pattern used in VectorStorageService)
```

## Property Names Preserved

**Intentionally kept the same for backward compatibility**:
- `this.vectorStorageManager` (instance property name)
- Method calls like `this.vectorStorageManager.storeToPinecone(...)`

This maintains API compatibility while improving the semantic clarity of the class name.

## Verification Results

✅ **All syntax checks passed**:
- `vectorStorageService.js` - No syntax errors
- `dataPreparationPipeline.js` - No syntax errors  
- `index.js` - No syntax errors

✅ **File system verification**:
- Old `vectorStorageManager.js` file successfully removed
- New `vectorStorageService.js` file exists and functional
- All import paths updated correctly

✅ **Semantic Improvement**:
- Name better reflects the role as a service rather than a manager
- Consistent with naming convention (e.g., `PineconeService`)
- Maintains architectural clarity and purpose

## Architecture Impact

The renaming has **no functional impact** on the system:
- Same functionality for vector storage operations
- Same interface and method signatures
- Same integration with PineconePlugin
- Same performance characteristics

The new name `VectorStorageService` better aligns with service-oriented architecture principles and provides clearer semantic meaning about the component's role in handling vector storage operations.
