# Wiki Module

## Overview

The `wiki` module is responsible for managing the core functionality of a wiki-based application. It provides the necessary entities and operations to create, update, and retrieve wiki-related data.

## Architecture

The module is structured around two main entities:

1. **Wiki**: Represents the overall wiki, containing a collection of wiki pages.
2. **WikiPage**: Represents a single page within the wiki, with properties such as title, content, and metadata.

The module utilizes these entities to perform various operations on the wiki data.

## Key Functionalities

1. **Wiki Management**:
   - Creating a new wiki
   - Retrieving an existing wiki
   - Updating the properties of a wiki

2. **WikiPage Management**:
   - Creating a new wiki page
   - Retrieving an existing wiki page
   - Updating the content and metadata of a wiki page

3. **Wiki Navigation**:
   - Retrieving a list of all wiki pages
   - Searching for wiki pages based on specific criteria (e.g., title, content)

4. **Wiki Versioning**:

   - Allowing users to view and revert to previous versions of a wiki page

5. **Access Control**:
   - Implementing user-based permissions for viewing, editing, and managing wiki content
   - Enforcing access restrictions based on user roles and privileges

The `wiki` module serves as the core component for managing the wiki-related data and functionality within the application.
