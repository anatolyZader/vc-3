# Chat Module

## Purpose
The `chat` module is responsible for handling the chat functionality of the application. It provides a set of APIs and event listeners to enable real-time communication between users.

## Architecture
The `chat` module is built using the Fastify framework and follows a modular architecture. The main entry point is the `index.js` file, which sets up the module's structure and registers various components:

1. **Controllers**: The module loads application controllers from the `application` directory, which handle the business logic for chat-related operations.
2. **Routers**: The module loads route definitions from the `input` directory, which define the API endpoints for the chat functionality.
3. **Pub/Sub Listener**: The module registers a Pub/Sub listener (`chatPubsubListener`) to handle incoming chat events.

The module also has the ability to register additional plugins, such as the `ragStatusPlugin`, which is currently commented out.

## Key Functionalities
The `chat` module provides the following key functionalities:

1. **Chat API Endpoints**: The module exposes a set of API endpoints for managing chat-related operations, such as sending messages, retrieving chat history, and managing user presence.
2. **Pub/Sub Event Handling**: The module registers a Pub/Sub listener to handle incoming chat events, such as new messages, user joins, and user leaves.
3. **Real-time Communication**: The module enables real-time communication between users by leveraging the Pub/Sub event handling mechanism.
4. **Modular Design**: The module follows a modular design, allowing for easy extensibility and maintainability of the chat functionality.

## Usage
To use the `chat` module, developers can interact with the exposed API endpoints and leverage the Pub/Sub event handling mechanism to build real-time chat features within the application.
