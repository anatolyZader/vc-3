# AI Prompt System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive prompt management system that addresses the issue where the AI was giving responses on general topics but still mentioning application-specific context inappropriately.

## Problem Resolved
**Issue**: AI responses to general knowledge questions (like "tell me the history of Earth") were incorrectly including references to application context, saying things like "Based on the information provided in the context... The context is focused on the technical details of the user's application"

**Root Cause**: The AI system was always passing application context to the LLM, even for general knowledge questions.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Centralized Prompt Management System
- **Created**: 6 specialized system prompts
  - `RAG System`: For application-specific queries with context
  - `Standard`: General software development assistance
  - `Code Analysis`: Specific code review and debugging
  - `API Specialist`: REST API and documentation focus
  - `General`: Pure general knowledge questions
  - `Fallback`: Basic assistance when other prompts don't match

### 2. Intelligent Prompt Selection
- **Algorithm**: Multi-factor analysis based on:
  - Question keyword matching
  - Context availability
  - Conversation history
  - Application-specific term detection

- **Priority Logic**:
  1. **Highest Priority**: General questions override everything else
  2. **Second Priority**: App-related questions with available context
  3. **Third Priority**: App-related questions without context
  4. **Default**: General knowledge handling

### 3. Conditional Context Passing
- **General Questions**: Pass only the question itself to the AI (no application context)
- **Technical Questions**: Include full RAG context for accurate technical assistance

### 4. Configuration-Driven Keywords
- **General Keywords**: `['what is', 'how does', 'explain', 'tell me about', 'history of', 'who invented', 'earth', 'science', 'physics', etc.]`
- **Application Keywords**: `['api', 'endpoint', 'database', 'function', 'method', 'class', 'error', 'bug', 'code', etc.]`
- **Easily Extensible**: Add new keywords in `promptConfig.js`

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`systemPrompts.js`** - Centralized prompt definitions and selection logic
2. **`promptConfig.js`** - Configuration for keywords, thresholds, and behavior
3. **`promptTester.js`** - Testing utilities for prompt validation
4. **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation

### Modified Files
1. **`aiLangchainAdapter.js`** - Integrated new prompt system and conditional context passing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Prompt Selection Logic
```javascript
// HIGHEST PRIORITY: General questions override everything else
if (isGeneralQuestion && !isAppRelated) {
  return SystemPrompts.general(conversationCount);
}

// SECOND PRIORITY: App-related questions with context
if (hasRagContext && isAppRelated) {
  // Select specialized prompt based on question type
}

// DEFAULT: General knowledge handling
return SystemPrompts.general(conversationCount);
```

### Conditional Context Passing
```javascript
if (isGeneralQuestion) {
  // Clean prompt without application context
  userMessage = { role: "user", content: prompt };
} else {
  // Include RAG context for technical questions
  userMessage = { role: "user", content: `Question: "${prompt}"\n\nContext:\n\n${context}` };
}
```

## Test Results
- **✅ General Questions**: "tell me the short history of Earth" → General prompt selected
- **✅ Technical Questions**: "how do I fix this API endpoint error?" → API Specialist prompt selected
- **✅ Code Questions**: "debug this JavaScript function" → Code Analysis prompt selected
- **✅ Context Separation**: General questions receive no application context

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Accurate Response Context**: General knowledge questions get clean, context-appropriate responses
2. **Maintained Technical Expertise**: Application-specific questions still receive full RAG context
3. **Scalable Configuration**: Easy to add new keywords and adjust behavior
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed prompt selection logging for debugging
5. **Backwards Compatible**: Existing functionality preserved

## Expected User Experience
- **Before**: "tell me about Earth" → "Based on the application context provided..."
- **After**: "tell me about Earth" → Clean, educational response about Earth's history

The system now intelligently distinguishes between general knowledge and technical questions, providing appropriate responses without inappropriate context references.
