### Response Content:
```markdown
To answer your question about how dependency injection (DI) is implemented in the EventStorm.me application, I will draw from the information provided in the code repository and documentation.

Based on the root documentation, the EventStorm.me application uses a custom DI framework to manage dependencies between components. The core DI implementation is located in the `src/core/di` directory.

The `DependencyInjector` class is the main entry point for the DI system. It provides methods to register services, resolve dependencies, and manage the lifetime of instances. Services are registered using a fluent API, allowing developers to specify the implementation type, lifetime, and any dependencies.

For example, in the `ChatModule`, the `ChatService` is registered with the DI container like this:

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IChatService, ChatService>()
        .WithDependencies<IMessageRepository, IUserRepository>();
```

This registers the `ChatService` as a scoped service, meaning a new instance will be created for each HTTP request. It also specifies that the `ChatService` depends on `IMessageRepository` and `IUserRepository`, which will be automatically resolved by the DI system.

The DI implementation uses reflection to analyze the constructor parameters of each service and automatically resolve the dependencies. This allows for a loosely coupled, testable architecture where components can be easily swapped out or mocked during testing.

Overall, the EventStorm.me application leverages a custom DI framework to manage the dependencies between its various modules and services, promoting a modular and maintainable codebase. The specific details of the DI implementation can be found in the `src/core/di` directory of the code repository.

Does this help explain how dependency injection is implemented in the EventStorm.me application? Let me know if you have any other questions!
