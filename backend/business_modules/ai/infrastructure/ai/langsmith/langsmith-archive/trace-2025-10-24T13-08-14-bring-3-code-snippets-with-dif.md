# Backend Application - Root Files & Plugins Documentation

## Overview
The backend application for EventStorm.me is built using the Fastify web framework. The application's core entry point is the `app.js` file, which initializes the Fastify server and registers various plugins that provide essential functionality. The `server.js` file is responsible for bootstrapping the application, while the `fastify.config.js` file contains the server configuration.

The application also utilizes a plugin-based architecture, where different functionalities are encapsulated in separate plugin files. These plugins are registered and integrated into the main application, allowing for a modular and extensible design.

## Core Application Files

### app.js
**Description**: Main application entry point

**Purpose and Role**:
The `app.js` file is the main entry point of the backend application. It is responsible for:
- Importing and registering various plugins and dependencies
- Configuring the Fastify server with essential settings and middleware
- Handling the application's lifecycle events, such as route registration

**Key Configurations**:
- Registering plugins like `loggingPlugin`, `schemaLoaderPlugin`, `envPlugin`, `diPlugin`, `websocketPlugin`, `fastifySensible`, `eventDispatcher`, `pubsubPlugin`, and more
- Configuring the `@fastify/helmet` plugin to set security-related HTTP headers
- Registering the `@fastify/cors` plugin to handle cross-origin resource sharing
- Configuring the `@fastify/swagger` plugin to generate OpenAPI documentation

**Application Initialization**:
The `app.js` file exports an asynchronous function that takes the Fastify instance and options as arguments. This function is responsible for initializing the application by registering the necessary plugins and configuring the server.

### server.js
**Description**: Fastify server configuration and startup

**Purpose and Role**:
The `server.js` file is responsible for bootstrapping the Fastify server. It imports the `app.js` module and exports it, allowing the application to be started.

**Server Startup Process**:
The `server.js` file simply requires the `app.js` module and exports it. This allows the Fastify server to be started by running the `server.js` file.

**Key Configurations**:
The `server.js` file does not contain any direct configurations. It relies on the configurations set in the `app.js` and `fastify.config.js` files.

### fastify.config.js
**Description**: Fastify server configuration

**Purpose and Role**:
The `fastify.config.js` file is responsible for providing the configuration options for the Fastify server. It is automatically loaded by the Fastify CLI when the application is started.

**Configuration Options**:
- `server.port`: The port on which the Fastify server will listen for incoming requests.
- `server.host`: The host address on which the Fastify server will listen for incoming requests.
- `options.trustProxy`: A boolean flag indicating whether the server should trust the proxy.

**Integration with the Application**:
The configurations defined in the `fastify.config.js` file are used by the Fastify server when it is started. These configurations are merged with the options passed to the Fastify instance in the `app.js` file.

## Plugins Architecture

### Plugin System Overview
The EventStorm.me backend application utilizes a plugin-based architecture, where various functionalities are encapsulated in separate plugin files. These plugins are registered and integrated into the main application using the Fastify plugin system.

The plugin system in Fastify allows for modular and extensible development, where each plugin can be independently developed, tested, and maintained. Plugins can also depend on other plugins, enabling a hierarchical and composable architecture.

Eventstorm.me Architecture

(In this document, file names are taken from the ai module for exemplary purposes.)

General Overview

Eventstorm.me is a full-stack React ‚Äì Fastify application.

Client Side

to be added‚Ä¶

Backend Side

Modular Monolith

Eventstorm.me backend is a modular monolith with two kinds of modules:

AOP modules ‚Äì for cross-cutting concerns

Business modules ‚Äì for main business concerns, 
Each business module represents a bounded context in Domain-Driven Design.

The Business modules represent the core business capabilities with strict boundaries and event-driven communication, while AOP modules provide shared technical services that cross module boundaries. This creates a clean separation between business concerns (what the system does) and technical concerns (how the system works), following both Domain-Driven Design and Aspect-Oriented Programming principles. 

This architecture allows Eventstorm.me to maintain a modular monolith that could potentially be split into microservices by extracting business modules while keeping AOP concerns as shared libraries or infrastructure services.

Difference in communication:

Business ‚Üí Business: async only via Pub/Sub (domain or integration events). No direct calls. Contracts = event schemas.

Business ‚Üí AOP: direct method calls (e.g., permissions.check(), auth.verify(), log.info()) through well-defined interfaces.

AOP ‚Üí Business: never call back into business logic (prevents cycles). AOP modules are dependency sinks.

AOP modules are globally accessible via Fastify decorators

DDD + Hexagonal Architecture:

Each module (AOP or business) is built according to DDD and Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) multilayered architecture, with a rich domain layer and strict isolation between layers.

Layers in Each Module:
1. Input

Incoming requests are accepted here.

The Input folder in the module directory usually includes:

aiRouter.js

HTTP route endpoints

Fastify schema for each endpoint

Pre-validation of request

Handler set (Fastify decorator function)

This function is defined in the controller file from the same module

aiPubsubListener.js

Listener for a given pubsub topic

Messages are received

Payload is extracted and transferred to the controller file method as a mocked Request object (to behave like an HTTP request)

Example:

subscription.on('message', async (message) => {
  fastify.log.info(`Received docs message ${message.id} on subscription ${subscriptionName}`);

  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(message.data.toString());

    if (data.event === 'fetchDocsRequest') {
      const { userId, repoId, correlationId } = data.payload;

      const mockRequest = {
        params: { repoId },
        user: { id: userId },
        userId
      };
      const mockReply = {};

      await fastify.fetchDocs(mockRequest, mockReply);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
  }
});

2. Controller

Each module includes a thin controller.

Purpose: accept a request object (or its mock), extract required data, call the module‚Äôs service file (aiService.js).

Each controller method is set up as a Fastify decorator.

Accessible to the module-specific child Fastify instance (isolated from the root instance by Fastify encapsulation).

3. Service

Contains the main business logic of the app.

Calls methods of domain entities/aggregates.

Replaces domain ports with specific adapters (ports and adapters / hexagonal).

Deals with persistence, messaging, etc.

Note: Controller + Service = Application Layer.

4. Domain

The domain layer includes a rich model with DDD tactical patterns:

Aggregates

Entities

Ports (persistence, messaging, AI, etc.)

Value objects

Domain events

The DDD ubiquitous language dictionary has been split into focused catalogs:
- `ubiq-language.json` - Pure business terminology and domain concepts
- `arch-catalog.json` - Architectural patterns, layers, and design principles  
- `infra-catalog.json` - Infrastructure configuration and technical dependencies
- `workflows.json` - High-level business processes and integration patterns

5. Infrastructure

The infrastructure layer includes specific adapters implementing ports from the domain layer to interact with external systems.

More than one adapter can exist for a port.

Example: aiPostgresAdapter.js and aiMySQLAdapter.js both implement IAIPersistPort.js.

Active adapter set in infraConfig.json.

Example:

{
  "aop_modules": {
    "auth": {
      "authPersistAdapter": "authPostgresAdapter"
    }
  },
  "business_modules": {
    "chat": {
      "chatPersistAdapter": "chatPostgresAdapter",
      "chatAiAdapter": "chatAiAdapter",
      "chatMessagingAdapter": "chatPubsubAdapter",
      "chatVoiceAdapter": "chatGCPVoiceAdapter"
    },
    "git": {
      "gitAdapter": "gitGithubAdapter",
      "gitMessagingAdapter": "gitPubsubAdapter",
      "gitPersistAdapter": "gitPostgresAdapter"
    },
    "docs": {
      "docsMessagingAdapter": "docsPubsubAdapter",
      "docsPersistAdapter": "docsPostgresAdapter",
      "docsAiAdapter": "docsLangchainAdapter",
      "docsGitAdapter": "docsGithubAdapter"
    },
    "ai": {
      "aiPersistAdapter": "aiPostgresAdapter",
      "aiAdapter": "aiLangchainAdapter",
      "aiProvider": "anthropic",
      "aiMessagingAdapter": "aiPubsubAdapter",
      "aiGitAdapter": "aiGithubAdapter",
      "aiDocsAdapter": "aiGithubDocsAdapter"
    },
    "messaging": {
      "messagingPersistAdapter": "messagingPostgresAdapter",
      "messagingAIAdapter": "messagingLangchainAdapter",
      "messagingMessagingAdapter": "messagingPubsubAdapter"
    },
    "api": {
      "apiPersistAdapter": "apiPostgresAdapter",
      "apiMessagingAdapter": "apiPubsubAdapter",
      "apiAdapter": "apiSwaggerAdapter"
    }
  }
}

Important Notes:

- Fastify code is limited to Input and Application layers.

- Domain and Infrastructure layers are isolated from Fastify, built on regular JS files (not Fastify plugins).

Additional Topics:

Dependency Injection

- Used in each module

- Keeps data flow inside-out (domain ‚Üí adapters)

- Implements hexagonal design effectively

Environmental Variables

- Set in .env file at root app directory

Backend For Frontend (BFF)

- Implemented partially

- Example: Chat module (handles user interaction via Chat UI)

Eventstorm.me Architecture

(In this document, file names are taken from the ai module for exemplary purposes.)

General Overview

Eventstorm.me is a full-stack React ‚Äì Fastify application.

Client Side

to be added‚Ä¶

Backend Side

Modular Monolith

Eventstorm.me backend is a modular monolith with two kinds of modules:

AOP modules ‚Äì for cross-cutting concerns

Business modules ‚Äì for main business concerns, 
Each business module represents a bounded context in Domain-Driven Design.

The Business modules represent the core business capabilities with strict boundaries and event-driven communication, while AOP modules provide shared technical services that cross module boundaries. This creates a clean separation between business concerns (what the system does) and technical concerns (how the system works), following both Domain-Driven Design and Aspect-Oriented Programming principles. 

This architecture allows Eventstorm.me to maintain a modular monolith that could potentially be split into microservices by extracting business modules while keeping AOP concerns as shared libraries or infrastructure services.

Difference in communication:

Business ‚Üí Business: async only via Pub/Sub (domain or integration events). No direct calls. Contracts = event schemas.

Business ‚Üí AOP: direct method calls (e.g., permissions.check(), auth.verify(), log.info()) through well-defined interfaces.

AOP ‚Üí Business: never call back into business logic (prevents cycles). AOP modules are dependency sinks.

AOP modules are globally accessible via Fastify decorators

DDD + Hexagonal Architecture:

Each module (AOP or business) is built according to DDD and Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) multilayered architecture, with a rich domain layer and strict isolation between layers.

Layers in Each Module:
1. Input

Incoming requests are accepted here.

The Input folder in the module directory usually includes:

aiRouter.js

HTTP route endpoints

Fastify schema for each endpoint

Pre-validation of request

Handler set (Fastify decorator function)

This function is defined in the controller file from the same module

aiPubsubListener.js

Listener for a given pubsub topic

Messages are received

Payload is extracted and transferred to the controller file method as a mocked Request object (to behave like an HTTP request)

Example:

subscription.on('message', async (message) => {
  fastify.log.info(`Received docs message ${message.id} on subscription ${subscriptionName}`);

  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(message.data.toString());

    if (data.event === 'fetchDocsRequest') {
      const { userId, repoId, correlationId } = data.payload;

      const mockRequest = {
        params: { repoId },
        user: { id: userId },
        userId
      };
      const mockReply = {};

      await fastify.fetchDocs(mockRequest, mockReply);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
  }
});

2. Controller

Eventstorm.me Architecture

(In this document, file names are taken from the ai module for exemplary purposes.)

General Overview

Eventstorm.me is a full-stack React ‚Äì Fastify application.

Client Side

to be added‚Ä¶

Backend Side

Modular Monolith

Eventstorm.me backend is a modular monolith with two kinds of modules:

AOP modules ‚Äì for cross-cutting concerns

Business modules ‚Äì for main business concerns, 
Each business module represents a bounded context in Domain-Driven Design.

The Business modules represent the core business capabilities with strict boundaries and event-driven communication, while AOP modules provide shared technical services that cross module boundaries. This creates a clean separation between business concerns (what the system does) and technical concerns (how the system works), following both Domain-Driven Design and Aspect-Oriented Programming principles. 

This architecture allows Eventstorm.me to maintain a modular monolith that could potentially be split into microservices by extracting business modules while keeping AOP concerns as shared libraries or infrastructure services.

Difference in communication:

Business ‚Üí Business: async only via Pub/Sub (domain or integration events). No direct calls. Contracts = event schemas.

Business ‚Üí AOP: direct method calls (e.g., permissions.check(), auth.verify(), log.info()) through well-defined interfaces.

AOP ‚Üí Business: never call back into business logic (prevents cycles). AOP modules are dependency sinks.

AOP modules are globally accessible via Fastify decorators

DDD + Hexagonal Architecture:

Each module (AOP or business) is built according to DDD and Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) multilayered architecture, with a rich domain layer and strict isolation between layers.

Layers in Each Module:
1. Input

Incoming requests are accepted here.

The Input folder in the module directory usually includes:

aiRouter.js

HTTP route endpoints

Fastify schema for each endpoint

Pre-validation of request

Handler set (Fastify decorator function)

This function is defined in the controller file from the same module

aiPubsubListener.js

Listener for a given pubsub topic

Messages are received

Payload is extracted and transferred to the controller file method as a mocked Request object (to behave like an HTTP request)

Example:

subscription.on('message', async (message) => {
  fastify.log.info(`Received docs message ${message.id} on subscription ${subscriptionName}`);

  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(message.data.toString());

    if (data.event === 'fetchDocsRequest') {
      const { userId, repoId, correlationId } = data.payload;

      const mockRequest = {
        params: { repoId },
        user: { id: userId },
        userId
      };
      const mockReply = {};

      await fastify.fetchDocs(mockRequest, mockReply);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
  }
});

2. Controller

Each module includes a thin controller.

Purpose: accept a request object (or its mock), extract required data, call the module‚Äôs service file (aiService.js).

Each controller method is set up as a Fastify decorator.

Accessible to the module-specific child Fastify instance (isolated from the root instance by Fastify encapsulation).

3. Service

Contains the main business logic of the app.

Calls methods of domain entities/aggregates.

Replaces domain ports with specific adapters (ports and adapters / hexagonal).

Deals with persistence, messaging, etc.

Note: Controller + Service = Application Layer.

4. Domain

The domain layer includes a rich model with DDD tactical patterns:

Aggregates

Entities

Ports (persistence, messaging, AI, etc.)

Value objects

Domain events

The DDD ubiquitous language dictionary has been split into focused catalogs:
- `ubiq-language.json` - Pure business terminology and domain concepts
- `arch-catalog.json` - Architectural patterns, layers, and design principles  
- `infra-catalog.json` - Infrastructure configuration and technical dependencies
- `workflows.json` - High-level business processes and integration patterns

5. Infrastructure

The infrastructure layer includes specific adapters implementing ports from the domain layer to interact with external systems.

More than one adapter can exist for a port.

Example: aiPostgresAdapter.js and aiMySQLAdapter.js both implement IAIPersistPort.js.

Active adapter set in infraConfig.json.

Example:

{
  "aop_modules": {
    "auth": {
      "authPersistAdapter": "authPostgresAdapter"
    }
  },
  "business_modules": {
    "chat": {
      "chatPersistAdapter": "chatPostgresAdapter",
      "chatAiAdapter": "chatAiAdapter",
      "chatMessagingAdapter": "chatPubsubAdapter",
      "chatVoiceAdapter": "chatGCPVoiceAdapter"
    },
    "git": {
      "gitAdapter": "gitGithubAdapter",
      "gitMessagingAdapter": "gitPubsubAdapter",
      "gitPersistAdapter": "gitPostgresAdapter"
    },
    "docs": {
      "docsMessagingAdapter": "docsPubsubAdapter",
      "docsPersistAdapter": "docsPostgresAdapter",
      "docsAiAdapter": "docsLangchainAdapter",
      "docsGitAdapter": "docsGithubAdapter"
    },
    "ai": {
      "aiPersistAdapter": "aiPostgresAdapter",
      "aiAdapter": "aiLangchainAdapter",
      "aiProvider": "anthropic",
      "aiMessagingAdapter": "aiPubsubAdapter",
      "aiGitAdapter": "aiGithubAdapter",
      "aiDocsAdapter": "aiGithubDocsAdapter"
    },
    "messaging": {
      "messagingPersistAdapter": "messagingPostgresAdapter",
      "messagingAIAdapter": "messagingLangchainAdapter",
      "messagingMessagingAdapter": "messagingPubsubAdapter"
    },
    "api": {
      "apiPersistAdapter": "apiPostgresAdapter",
      "apiMessagingAdapter": "apiPubsubAdapter",
      "apiAdapter": "apiSwaggerAdapter"
    }
  }
}

Important Notes:

- Fastify code is limited to Input and Application layers.

- Domain and Infrastructure layers are isolated from Fastify, built on regular JS files (not Fastify plugins).

Additional Topics:

Dependency Injection

- Used in each module

- Keeps data flow inside-out (domain ‚Üí adapters)

- Implements hexagonal design effectively

Environmental Variables

- Set in .env file at root app directory

Backend For Frontend (BFF)

- Implemented partially

- Example: Chat module (handles user interaction via Chat UI)
