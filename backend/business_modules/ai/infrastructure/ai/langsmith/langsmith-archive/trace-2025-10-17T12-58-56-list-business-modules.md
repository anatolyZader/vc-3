Eventstorm.me Architecture

(In this document, file names are taken from the ai module for exemplary purposes.)

General Overview

Eventstorm.me is a full-stack React ‚Äì Fastify application.

Client Side

to be added‚Ä¶

Backend Side

Modular Monolith

Eventstorm.me backend is a modular monolith with two kinds of modules:

AOP modules ‚Äì for cross-cutting concerns

Business modules ‚Äì for main business concerns, 
Each business module represents a bounded context in Domain-Driven Design.

The Business modules represent the core business capabilities with strict boundaries and event-driven communication, while AOP modules provide shared technical services that cross module boundaries. This creates a clean separation between business concerns (what the system does) and technical concerns (how the system works), following both Domain-Driven Design and Aspect-Oriented Programming principles. 

This architecture allows Eventstorm.me to maintain a modular monolith that could potentially be split into microservices by extracting business modules while keeping AOP concerns as shared libraries or infrastructure services.

Difference in communication:

Business ‚Üí Business: async only via Pub/Sub (domain or integration events). No direct calls. Contracts = event schemas.

Business ‚Üí AOP: direct method calls (e.g., permissions.check(), auth.verify(), log.info()) through well-defined interfaces.

Eventstorm.me Architecture

(In this document, file names are taken from the ai module for exemplary purposes.)

General Overview

Eventstorm.me is a full-stack React ‚Äì Fastify application.

Client Side

to be added‚Ä¶

Backend Side

Modular Monolith

Eventstorm.me backend is a modular monolith with two kinds of modules:

AOP modules ‚Äì for cross-cutting concerns

Business modules ‚Äì for main business concerns, 
Each business module represents a bounded context in Domain-Driven Design.

The Business modules represent the core business capabilities with strict boundaries and event-driven communication, while AOP modules provide shared technical services that cross module boundaries. This creates a clean separation between business concerns (what the system does) and technical concerns (how the system works), following both Domain-Driven Design and Aspect-Oriented Programming principles. 

This architecture allows Eventstorm.me to maintain a modular monolith that could potentially be split into microservices by extracting business modules while keeping AOP concerns as shared libraries or infrastructure services.

Difference in communication:

Business ‚Üí Business: async only via Pub/Sub (domain or integration events). No direct calls. Contracts = event schemas.

Business ‚Üí AOP: direct method calls (e.g., permissions.check(), auth.verify(), log.info()) through well-defined interfaces.

AOP ‚Üí Business: never call back into business logic (prevents cycles). AOP modules are dependency sinks.

AOP modules are globally accessible via Fastify decorators

DDD + Hexagonal Architecture:

Each module (AOP or business) is built according to DDD and Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) multilayered architecture, with a rich domain layer and strict isolation between layers.

Layers in Each Module:
1. Input

Incoming requests are accepted here.

The Input folder in the module directory usually includes:

aiRouter.js

HTTP route endpoints

Fastify schema for each endpoint

Pre-validation of request

Handler set (Fastify decorator function)

This function is defined in the controller file from the same module

aiPubsubListener.js

Listener for a given pubsub topic

Messages are received

Payload is extracted and transferred to the controller file method as a mocked Request object (to behave like an HTTP request)

Example:

subscription.on('message', async (message) => {
  fastify.log.info(`Received docs message ${message.id} on subscription ${subscriptionName}`);

  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(message.data.toString());

    if (data.event === 'fetchDocsRequest') {
      const { userId, repoId, correlationId } = data.payload;

      const mockRequest = {
        params: { repoId },
        user: { id: userId },
        userId
      };
      const mockReply = {};

      await fastify.fetchDocs(mockRequest, mockReply);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
  }
});

2. Controller

Each module includes a thin controller.

Purpose: accept a request object (or its mock), extract required data, call the module‚Äôs service file (aiService.js).

Each controller method is set up as a Fastify decorator.

Accessible to the module-specific child Fastify instance (isolated from the root instance by Fastify encapsulation).

3. Service

Contains the main business logic of the app.

Calls methods of domain entities/aggregates.

Replaces domain ports with specific adapters (ports and adapters / hexagonal).

Deals with persistence, messaging, etc.

Note: Controller + Service = Application Layer.

4. Domain

The domain layer includes a rich model with DDD tactical patterns:

Aggregates

Entities

Ports (persistence, messaging, AI, etc.)

Value objects

Domain events

ubiqLangDict.json file includes the app's ddd ubiquitous language dictionary / glossary

5. Infrastructure

The infrastructure layer includes specific adapters implementing ports from the domain layer to interact with external systems.

More than one adapter can exist for a port.

Example: aiPostgresAdapter.js and aiMySQLAdapter.js both implement IAIPersistPort.js.

Active adapter set in infraConfig.json.

Example:

{
  "aop_modules": {
    "auth": {
      "authPersistAdapter": "authPostgresAdapter"
    }
  },
  "business_modules": {
    "chat": {

      "chatAiAdapter": "chatAiAdapter",
      "chatMessagingAdapter": "chatPubsubAdapter",
      "chatVoiceAdapter": "chatGCPVoiceAdapter"
    },
    "git": {
      "gitAdapter": "gitGithubAdapter",
      "gitMessagingAdapter": "gitPubsubAdapter",
      "gitPersistAdapter": "gitPostgresAdapter"
    },
    "docs": {
      "docsMessagingAdapter": "docsPubsubAdapter",
      "docsPersistAdapter": "docsPostgresAdapter",
      "docsAiAdapter": "docsLangchainAdapter",
      "docsGitAdapter": "docsGithubAdapter"
    },
    "ai": {
      "aiPersistAdapter": "aiPostgresAdapter",
      "aiAdapter": "aiLangchainAdapter",
      "aiProvider": "anthropic",
      "aiMessagingAdapter": "aiPubsubAdapter",
      "aiGitAdapter": "aiGithubAdapter",
      "aiDocsAdapter": "aiGithubDocsAdapter"
    },
    "messaging": {
      "messagingPersistAdapter": "messagingPostgresAdapter",
      "messagingAIAdapter": "messagingLangchainAdapter",
      "messagingMessagingAdapter": "messagingPubsubAdapter"
    },
    "api": {
      "apiPersistAdapter": "apiPostgresAdapter",
      "apiMessagingAdapter": "apiPubsubAdapter",
      "apiAdapter": "apiSwaggerAdapter"
    }
  }
}

Important Notes:

- Fastify code is limited to Input and Application layers.

- Domain and Infrastructure layers are isolated from Fastify, built on regular JS files (not Fastify plugins).

Additional Topics:

Dependency Injection

- Used in each module

- Keeps data flow inside-out (domain ‚Üí adapters)

- Implements hexagonal design effectively

Environmental Variables

- Set in .env file at root app directory

Backend For Frontend (BFF)

- Implemented partially

- Example: Chat module (handles user interaction via Chat UI)

Eventstorm.me Architecture

(In this document, file names are taken from the ai module for exemplary purposes.)

General Overview

Eventstorm.me is a full-stack React ‚Äì Fastify application.

Client Side

to be added‚Ä¶

Backend Side

Modular Monolith

Eventstorm.me backend is a modular monolith with two kinds of modules:

AOP modules ‚Äì for cross-cutting concerns

Business modules ‚Äì for main business concerns, 
Each business module represents a bounded context in Domain-Driven Design.

The Business modules represent the core business capabilities with strict boundaries and event-driven communication, while AOP modules provide shared technical services that cross module boundaries. This creates a clean separation between business concerns (what the system does) and technical concerns (how the system works), following both Domain-Driven Design and Aspect-Oriented Programming principles. 

This architecture allows Eventstorm.me to maintain a modular monolith that could potentially be split into microservices by extracting business modules while keeping AOP concerns as shared libraries or infrastructure services.

Difference in communication:

Business ‚Üí Business: async only via Pub/Sub (domain or integration events). No direct calls. Contracts = event schemas.

Business ‚Üí AOP: direct method calls (e.g., permissions.check(), auth.verify(), log.info()) through well-defined interfaces.

AOP ‚Üí Business: never call back into business logic (prevents cycles). AOP modules are dependency sinks.

AOP modules are globally accessible via Fastify decorators

DDD + Hexagonal Architecture:

Each module (AOP or business) is built according to DDD and Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) multilayered architecture, with a rich domain layer and strict isolation between layers.

Layers in Each Module:
1. Input

Incoming requests are accepted here.

The Input folder in the module directory usually includes:

aiRouter.js

HTTP route endpoints

Fastify schema for each endpoint

Pre-validation of request

Handler set (Fastify decorator function)

This function is defined in the controller file from the same module

aiPubsubListener.js

Listener for a given pubsub topic

Messages are received

Payload is extracted and transferred to the controller file method as a mocked Request object (to behave like an HTTP request)

Example:

subscription.on('message', async (message) => {
  fastify.log.info(`Received docs message ${message.id} on subscription ${subscriptionName}`);

  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(message.data.toString());

    if (data.event === 'fetchDocsRequest') {
      const { userId, repoId, correlationId } = data.payload;

      const mockRequest = {
        params: { repoId },
        user: { id: userId },
        userId
      };
      const mockReply = {};

      await fastify.fetchDocs(mockRequest, mockReply);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
  }
});

2. Controller

Each module includes a thin controller.

Purpose: accept a request object (or its mock), extract required data, call the module‚Äôs service file (aiService.js).

Each controller method is set up as a Fastify decorator.

Accessible to the module-specific child Fastify instance (isolated from the root instance by Fastify encapsulation).

3. Service

Contains the main business logic of the app.

Calls methods of domain entities/aggregates.

Replaces domain ports with specific adapters (ports and adapters / hexagonal).

Deals with persistence, messaging, etc.

Note: Controller + Service = Application Layer.

4. Domain

The domain layer includes a rich model with DDD tactical patterns:

Aggregates

Entities

Ports (persistence, messaging, AI, etc.)

Value objects

Domain events

ubiqLangDict.json file includes the app's ddd ubiquitous language dictionary / glossary

5. Infrastructure

The infrastructure layer includes specific adapters implementing ports from the domain layer to interact with external systems.

More than one adapter can exist for a port.

Example: aiPostgresAdapter.js and aiMySQLAdapter.js both implement IAIPersistPort.js.

Active adapter set in infraConfig.json.

Example:

{
  "aop_modules": {
    "auth": {
      "authPersistAdapter": "authPostgresAdapter"
    }
  },
  "business_modules": {
    "chat": {
      "chatPersistAdapter": "chatPostgresAdapter",
      "chatAiAdapter": "chatAiAdapter",
      "chatMessagingAdapter": "chatPubsubAdapter",
      "chatVoiceAdapter": "chatGCPVoiceAdapter"
    },
    "git": {
      "gitAdapter": "gitGithubAdapter",
      "gitMessagingAdapter": "gitPubsubAdapter",
      "gitPersistAdapter": "gitPostgresAdapter"
    },
    "docs": {
      "docsMessagingAdapter": "docsPubsubAdapter",
      "docsPersistAdapter": "docsPostgresAdapter",
      "docsAiAdapter": "docsLangchainAdapter",
      "docsGitAdapter": "docsGithubAdapter"
    },
    "ai": {
      "aiPersistAdapter": "aiPostgresAdapter",
      "aiAdapter": "aiLangchainAdapter",
      "aiProvider": "anthropic",
      "aiMessagingAdapter": "aiPubsubAdapter",
      "aiGitAdapter": "aiGithubAdapter",
      "aiDocsAdapter": "aiGithubDocsAdapter"
    },
    "messaging": {
      "messagingPersistAdapter": "messagingPostgresAdapter",
      "messagingAIAdapter": "messagingLangchainAdapter",
      "messagingMessagingAdapter": "messagingPubsubAdapter"
    },
    "api": {
      "apiPersistAdapter": "apiPostgresAdapter",
      "apiMessagingAdapter": "apiPubsubAdapter",
      "apiAdapter": "apiSwaggerAdapter"
    }
  }
}

Important Notes:

- Fastify code is limited to Input and Application layers.

- Domain and Infrastructure layers are isolated from Fastify, built on regular JS files (not Fastify plugins).

Additional Topics:

Dependency Injection

- Used in each module

- Keeps data flow inside-out (domain ‚Üí adapters)

- Implements hexagonal design effectively

Environmental Variables

- Set in .env file at root app directory

Backend For Frontend (BFF)

- Implemented partially

- Example: Chat module (handles user interaction via Chat UI)

## Technology Stack

The `eventstorm.me` application is built using the following technology stack:

- **Framework**: Fastify, a high-performance Node.js web framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, a powerful and scalable relational database
- **Messaging**: PubSub (e.g., Google Cloud Pub/Sub, RabbitMQ), for reliable and scalable message delivery
- **AI Integration**: Langchain, a framework for building applications with large language models
- **Authentication**: OAuth2, a widely adopted authentication and authorization protocol
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI (Swagger), a standard for describing RESTful APIs

## Data Flow

The data flow within the `eventstorm.me` application follows the Hexagonal Architecture pattern, where the core business logic is isolated from the technical implementation details:

1. The client (e.g., a web application or a mobile app) sends a request to the API module.
2. The API module's router handles the incoming request and delegates the processing to the appropriate API service.
3. The API service interacts with the domain entities and the necessary ports (interfaces) to fulfill the request.

The `eventstorm.me` application is built using the following technology stack:

- **Framework**: Fastify, a high-performance Node.js web framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, a powerful and scalable relational database
- **Messaging**: PubSub (e.g., Google Cloud Pub/Sub, RabbitMQ), for reliable and scalable message delivery
- **AI Integration**: Langchain, a framework for building applications with large language models
- **Authentication**: OAuth2, a widely adopted authentication and authorization protocol
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI (Swagger), a standard for describing RESTful APIs

## Data Flow

The data flow within the `eventstorm.me` application follows the Hexagonal Architecture pattern, where the core business logic is isolated from the technical implementation details:

1. The client (e.g., a web application or a mobile app) sends a request to the API module.
2. The API module's router handles the incoming request and delegates the processing to the appropriate API service.
3. The API service interacts with the domain entities and the necessary ports (interfaces) to fulfill the request.
