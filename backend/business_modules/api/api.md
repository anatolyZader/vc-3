# API Module

## Purpose
The `api` module is responsible for managing the HTTP API functionality of the application. It provides endpoints for fetching and retrieving the OpenAPI specification (Swagger) for a given user and repository.

## Architecture
The module follows a layered architecture, with the following key components:

1. **API Router**: Defines the HTTP routes and handlers for the API endpoints, including the `/httpApi` endpoint for fetching the HTTP API and the `/read-api` endpoint for retrieving the OpenAPI specification.
2. **API Service**: Encapsulates the business logic for fetching the HTTP API, including interacting with the `HttpApi` domain entity and publishing a `HttpApiFetchedEvent` domain event.
3. **HttpApi Domain Entity**: Represents the HTTP API and provides the logic for fetching the API from the `IApiPort` and persisting it using the `IApiPersistPort`.
4. **API Adapter**: Implements the `IApiPort` interface, responsible for fetching the OpenAPI specification from a specified location (in this case, a local file).

## Key Functionalities
1. **Fetch HTTP API**: The `/httpApi` endpoint allows users to fetch the HTTP API for a given repository. The API is fetched, persisted, and a domain event is published to notify other parts of the system.
2. **Read API/Swagger**: The `/read-api` endpoint provides access to the OpenAPI specification (Swagger) for the application's HTTP API.
