Eventstorm.me Architecture

(In this document, file names are taken from the ai module for exemplary purposes.)

General Overview

Eventstorm.me is a full-stack React – Fastify application.

Client Side

Backend Side
Modular Monolith

Eventstorm.me backend is a modular monolith with two kinds of modules:

AOP modules – for cross-cutting concerns

Business modules – for main functional concerns

Difference in communication:

Business modules are strictly isolated / encapsulated and interact with other modules only via pubsub messaging.

AOP modules are not encapsulated and are accessible to other modules via direct http / method calls.

DDD + Hexagonal Architecture

Each module (AOP or business) is built according to DDD and Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) multilayered architecture, with a rich domain layer and strict isolation between layers.

Layers in Each Module
1. Input

Incoming requests are accepted here.

The Input folder in the module directory usually includes:

aiRouter.js

HTTP route endpoints

Fastify schema for each endpoint

Pre-validation of request

Handler set (Fastify decorator function)

This function is defined in the controller file from the same module

aiPubsubListener.js

Listener for a given pubsub topic

Messages are received

Payload is extracted and transferred to the controller file method as a mocked Request object (to behave like an HTTP request)

Example:

subscription.on('message', async (message) => {
  fastify.log.info(`Received wiki message ${message.id} on subscription ${subscriptionName}`);

  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(message.data.toString());

    if (data.event === 'fetchWikiRequest') {
      const { userId, repoId, correlationId } = data.payload;

      const mockRequest = {
        params: { repoId },
        user: { id: userId },
        userId
      };
      const mockReply = {};

      await fastify.fetchWiki(mockRequest, mockReply);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
  }
});

2. Controller

Each module includes a thin controller.

Purpose: accept a request object (or its mock), extract required data, call the module’s service file (aiService.js).

Each controller method is set up as a Fastify decorator.

Accessible to the module-specific child Fastify instance (isolated from the root instance by Fastify encapsulation).

3. Service

Contains the main business logic of the app.

Calls methods of domain entities/aggregates.

Replaces domain ports with specific adapters (ports and adapters / hexagonal).

Deals with persistence, messaging, etc.

Note: Controller + Service = Application Layer.

4. Domain

The domain layer includes a rich model with DDD tactical patterns:

Aggregates

Entities

Ports (persistence, messaging, AI, etc.)

Value objects

Domain events

5. Infrastructure

The infrastructure layer includes specific adapters implementing ports from the domain layer to interact with external systems.

More than one adapter can exist for a port.

Example: aiPostgresAdapter.js and aiMySQLAdapter.js both implement IAIPersistPort.js.

Active adapter set in infraConfig.json.

Example:

{
  "aop_modules": {
    "auth": {
      "authPersistAdapter": "authPostgresAdapter"
    }
  },
  "business_modules": {
    "chat": {
      "chatPersistAdapter": "chatPostgresAdapter",
      "chatAiAdapter": "chatAiAdapter",
      "chatMessagingAdapter": "chatPubsubAdapter",
      "chatVoiceAdapter": "chatGCPVoiceAdapter"
    },
    "git": {
      "gitAdapter": "gitGithubAdapter",
      "gitMessagingAdapter": "gitPubsubAdapter",
      "gitPersistAdapter": "gitPostgresAdapter"
    },
    "wiki": {
      "wikiMessagingAdapter": "wikiPubsubAdapter",
      "wikiPersistAdapter": "wikiPostgresAdapter",
      "wikiAiAdapter": "wikiLangchainAdapter",
      "wikiGitAdapter": "wikiGithubAdapter"
    },
    "ai": {
      "aiPersistAdapter": "aiPostgresAdapter",
      "aiAdapter": "aiLangchainAdapter",
      "aiProvider": "anthropic",
      "aiMessagingAdapter": "aiPubsubAdapter",
      "aiGitAdapter": "aiGithubAdapter",
      "aiWikiAdapter": "aiGithubWikiAdapter"
    },
    "messaging": {
      "messagingPersistAdapter": "messagingPostgresAdapter",
      "messagingAIAdapter": "messagingLangchainAdapter",
      "messagingMessagingAdapter": "messagingPubsubAdapter"
    },
    "api": {
      "apiPersistAdapter": "apiPostgresAdapter",
      "apiMessagingAdapter": "apiPubsubAdapter",
      "apiAdapter": "apiSwaggerAdapter"
    }
  }
}

Important Notes:

- Fastify code is limited to Input and Application layers.

- Domain and Infrastructure layers are isolated from Fastify, built on regular JS files (not Fastify plugins).

Additional Topics:

Dependency Injection

- Used in each module

- Keeps data flow inside-out (domain → adapters)

- Implements hexagonal design effectively

Environmental Variables

- Set in .env file at root app directory

Backend For Frontend (BFF)

- Implemented partially

- Example: Chat module (handles user interaction via Chat UI)
