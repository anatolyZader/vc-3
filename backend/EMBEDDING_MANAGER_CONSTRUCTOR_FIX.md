# Fixed EmbeddingManager Constructor Shadowing Issue

## Problem
The `EmbeddingManager` constructor had several issues:

1. **Unused import**: `const pineconeService = require('./pineconeService');` at the top was never used
2. **Variable shadowing**: `this.pineconeService` was assigned multiple times confusingly  
3. **Syntax error**: `options.pineconeService || ;` had invalid syntax
4. **Inconsistent logic**: Threw error if missing, then tried to use fallback logic

## Before (Problematic Code)
```javascript
const pineconeService = require('./pineconeService'); // UNUSED IMPORT

class EmbeddingManager {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    this.embeddings = options.embeddings;
    this.pineconeLimiter = options.pineconeLimiter;
    this.pineconeService = pineconeService; // SHADOWED - never used
    
    // Require PineconeService as a dependency - don't create it ourselves
    if (!options.pineconeService) {
      throw new Error('EmbeddingManager requires a pineconeService instance. Pass it via options.pineconeService');
    }
    
    this.pineconeService = options.pineconeService || ; // SYNTAX ERROR
    
    // Backward compatibility alias
    this.pinecone = this.pineconeService;
  }
}
```

## After (Fixed Code)
```javascript
// Removed unused import

class EmbeddingManager {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    this.embeddings = options.embeddings;
    this.pineconeLimiter = options.pineconeLimiter;
    
    // Require PineconeService as a dependency - don't create it ourselves
    if (!options.pineconeService) {
      throw new Error('EmbeddingManager requires a pineconeService instance. Pass it via options.pineconeService');
    }
    
    this.pineconeService = options.pineconeService; // Clean assignment
    
    // Backward compatibility alias
    this.pinecone = this.pineconeService;
  }
}
```

## Changes Made

### ✅ Removed Unused Import
- Deleted `const pineconeService = require('./pineconeService');` 
- This import was never used and created confusion

### ✅ Fixed Constructor Logic
- Removed the shadowing assignment `this.pineconeService = pineconeService;`
- Fixed syntax error in `options.pineconeService || ;`
- Simplified to single, clean assignment: `this.pineconeService = options.pineconeService;`

### ✅ Maintained Error Handling
- Kept the validation that throws error when `options.pineconeService` is missing
- This ensures proper dependency injection

### ✅ Preserved Backward Compatibility
- Kept the `this.pinecone = this.pineconeService;` alias for existing code

## Benefits
- ✅ **Cleaner code**: Removed confusing unused import and shadowing
- ✅ **Fixed syntax**: Eliminated syntax error that would cause runtime issues
- ✅ **Clear intent**: Constructor now clearly shows it requires dependency injection
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Easier to understand and modify
- ✅ **Proper dependency injection**: Forces explicit passing of pineconeService instance

## Testing
Created test file that verifies:
- Constructor throws appropriate error when pineconeService is missing
- Constructor works correctly when pineconeService is provided
- Backward compatibility alias functions properly
- No syntax or runtime errors

## Usage (Unchanged)
```javascript
const pineconeService = new PineconeService(options);
const embeddingManager = new EmbeddingManager({
  embeddings: embeddings,
  pineconeLimiter: limiter,
  pineconeService: pineconeService  // Must be provided
});
```

This fix follows the **dependency injection pattern** properly by requiring the pineconeService to be explicitly passed in rather than trying to manage it internally.
