# Backend Application - Root Files & Plugins Documentation

## Overview
The backend application for EventStorm.me is built using the Fastify web framework. The application's core entry point is the `app.js` file, which initializes the Fastify server and registers various plugins that provide essential functionality. The `server.js` file is responsible for bootstrapping the application, while the `fastify.config.js` file contains the server configuration.

The application also utilizes a plugin-based architecture, where different functionalities are encapsulated in separate plugin files. These plugins are registered and integrated into the main application, allowing for a modular and extensible design.

## Core Application Files

### app.js
**Description**: Main application entry point

**Purpose and Role**:
The `app.js` file is the main entry point of the backend application. It is responsible for:
- Importing and registering various plugins and dependencies
- Configuring the Fastify server with essential settings and middleware
- Handling the application's lifecycle events, such as route registration

**Key Configurations**:
- Registering plugins like `loggingPlugin`, `schemaLoaderPlugin`, `envPlugin`, `diPlugin`, `websocketPlugin`, `fastifySensible`, `eventDispatcher`, `pubsubPlugin`, and more
- Configuring the `@fastify/helmet` plugin to set security-related HTTP headers
- Registering the `@fastify/cors` plugin to handle cross-origin resource sharing
- Configuring the `@fastify/swagger` plugin to generate OpenAPI documentation

**Application Initialization**:
The `app.js` file exports an asynchronous function that takes the Fastify instance and options as arguments. This function is responsible for initializing the application by registering the necessary plugins and configuring the server.

### server.js
**Description**: Fastify server configuration and startup

**Purpose and Role**:
The `server.js` file is responsible for bootstrapping the Fastify server. It imports the `app.js` module and exports it, allowing the application to be started.

**Server Startup Process**:
The `server.js` file simply requires the `app.js` module and exports it. This allows the Fastify server to be started by running the `server.js` file.

**Key Configurations**:
The `server.js` file does not contain any direct configurations. It relies on the configurations set in the `app.js` and `fastify.config.js` files.

### fastify.config.js
**Description**: Fastify server configuration

**Purpose and Role**:
The `fastify.config.js` file is responsible for providing the configuration options for the Fastify server. It is automatically loaded by the Fastify CLI when the application is started.

**Configuration Options**:
- `server.port`: The port on which the Fastify server will listen for incoming requests.
- `server.host`: The host address on which the Fastify server will listen for incoming requests.
- `options.trustProxy`: A boolean flag indicating whether the server should trust the proxy.

**Integration with the Application**:
The configurations defined in the `fastify.config.js` file are used by the Fastify server when it is started. These configurations are merged with the options passed to the Fastify instance in the `app.js` file.

## Plugins Architecture

### Plugin System Overview
The EventStorm.me backend application utilizes a plugin-based architecture, where various functionalities are encapsulated in separate plugin files. These plugins are registered and integrated into the main application using the Fastify plugin system.

The plugin system in Fastify allows for modular and extensible development, where each plugin can be independently developed, tested, and maintained. Plugins can also depend on other plugins, enabling a hierarchical and composable architecture.

### Individual Plugins

#### corsPlugin.js
**Purpose**: The `corsPlugin.js` file configures the `@fastify/cors` plugin, which handles cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for the application.

**Key Features**:
- Configures the allowed origin domains for CORS requests.
- Enables the `credentials` option to allow sending and receiving cookies in cross-origin requests.

**Configuration**:
- The allowed origin domains are configured in the `origin` option.
- The `credentials` option is set to `true` to allow sending and receiving cookies.

**Integration**:
The `corsPlugin` is registered in the `app.js` file, allowing the CORS configuration to be applied to the entire application.

#### diPlugin.js
**Purpose**: The `diPlugin.js` file sets up the Dependency Injection (DI) system for the application using the `@fastify/awilix` plugin.

**Key Features**:
- Registers various application services and adapters in the DI container.
- Configures the DI container to automatically dispose of resources when the Fastify server is closed or when a response is sent.

**Configuration**:
- Registers the `fastifyAwilixPlugin` with the Fastify instance.
- Configures the DI container with the `disposeOnClose`, `disposeOnResponse`, and `injectionMode` options.
- Registers basic dependencies like the `cloudSqlConnector` and `pubSubClient`.
- Registers various application-specific services and adapters.

**Integration**:
The `diPlugin` is registered in the `app.js` file, allowing the DI container to be used throughout the application.

#### envPlugin.js
**Purpose**: The `envPlugin.js` file sets up the environment variable configuration for the application using the `@fastify/env` plugin.

**Key Features**:
- Loads the environment variable schema defined in the `schema:dotenv` schema.
- Registers the `@fastify/env` plugin with the Fastify instance, attaching the validated environment variables to the `fastify.secrets` object.

**Configuration**:
- The environment variable schema is loaded from the `schema:dotenv` schema.
- The `confKey` option is set to `'secrets'`, which determines the property name under which the validated environment variables will be attached to the Fastify instance.

**Integration**:
The `envPlugin` is registered in the `app.js` file, ensuring that the environment variables are properly loaded and accessible throughout the application.

#### errorPlugin.js
**Purpose**: The `errorPlugin.js` file sets up the error handling mechanism for the application.

**Key Features**:
- Configures the Fastify error handler to handle errors that occur during request processing.
- Logs errors with the appropriate log level based on the HTTP status code.
- Sends a standardized error response to the client.

**Configuration**:
- The error handler is registered using the `setErrorHandler` method provided by Fastify.
- The error handling logic is implemented within the registered error handler function.

**Integration**:
The `errorPlugin` is registered in the `app.js` file, ensuring that errors are properly handled and logged throughout the application.

## Application Lifecycle
The backend application's lifecycle can be summarized as follows:

1. **Startup**:
   - The `server.js` file is executed, which imports and exports the `app.js` module.
   - The `app.js` file is loaded, and the main application initialization function is executed.
   - The `app.js` function registers the various plugins and configures the Fastify server.
   - The Fastify server is started, and it begins listening for incoming requests.

2. **Request Processing**:
   - When a request is received, Fastify routes it to the appropriate handler.
   - The handler may utilize services and adapters registered in the DI container.
   - If an error occurs during request processing, the error handler configured in the `errorPlugin` is invoked.

3. **Shutdown**:
   - When the Fastify server is stopped (e.g., during application shutdown), the registered plugins' `disposeOnClose` and `disposeOnResponse` configurations ensure that resources are properly cleaned up.

## Development Notes
- **Configuration Requirements**: The application relies on various environment variables, which are loaded and validated using the `@fastify/env` plugin. Ensure that all required environment variables are properly set during development and deployment.
- **Plugin Dependencies**: The application's plugins may have dependencies on each other or on external services (e.g., Redis, Pub/Sub). Ensure that these dependencies are properly configured and available during development and deployment.
- **Logging and Debugging**: The application utilizes the `loggingPlugin` to handle logging. Developers should use the provided logging facilities (e.g., `fastify.log`) for effective debugging and troubleshooting.
- **Best Practices**: Follow Fastify's recommended best practices for plugin development, such as using `fastify-plugin` to ensure proper encapsulation and integration with the Fastify ecosystem.
