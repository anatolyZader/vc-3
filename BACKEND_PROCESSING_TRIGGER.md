# EventStorm.me - Backend Processing Trigger

This file is used to trigger reprocessing of the repository with updated cloud-native backend loading.

**Cloud-Native Loader Update**: Implemented direct GitHub API tree traversal for backend file access.

**Dependency Injection in EventStorm**: 
The EventStorm backend implements dependency injection through several patterns:
- Plugin-based architecture with dependency registration
- Event-driven components with injectable services  
- Modular business logic with interface-based dependencies
