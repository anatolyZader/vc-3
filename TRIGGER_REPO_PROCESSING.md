# Repository Processing Trigger

This file was created to trigger repository processing after Pinecone index cleanup.

**Status**: Index recreated, triggering repository reprocessing to populate namespace `d41402df-182a-41ec-8f05-153118bf2718_anatolyzader_vc-3`.

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-18T12:39:00Z

**Expected Result**: 
- Namespace creation in Pinecone
- Vector population with actual code files
- AI assistant returning code-specific responses

## Next Steps
1. GitHub Actions will trigger on this commit
2. Repository processing pipeline will run
3. Vectors will be created in the clean Pinecone index
4. AI responses will improve significantly
